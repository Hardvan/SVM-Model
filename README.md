# SVM-Model
SVM Model to classify the three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). The dataset is imported from seaborn's collection of predefined datasets. It's a really small dataset with around 150 records, which explains the F1 score being 1 for all three species of Iris.
